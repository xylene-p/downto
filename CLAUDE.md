## Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (auth, Postgres, RLS, Realtime, DB triggers)

## Workflow
- Bugs and feature requests are tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xylene-p/downto/issues).
- Work on the next highest priority issue unless I say otherwise.
- Update TODO.md when tasks are completed or new issues are found.
