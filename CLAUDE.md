Event saving app with social layer. Save events from Instagram to your calendar, see who else is going, form small crews.

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- No CSS framework — inline styles, Space Mono + Instrument Serif fonts, dark theme with #E8FF5A accent

## Current state
- Interactive prototype with mock data
- Feed, calendar, crews, profile tabs
- Paste IG link flow (simulated scraping)
- Social drawer with ping/wave actions

## Next up
- Real IG scraping or manual event entry
- Auth + user accounts
- Actual group chat formation
- Calendar sync (Google/Apple)

## Workflow
- Always read TODO.md at the start of every session. Reference it for current project state and priorities.
- Work on the next highest priority MVP blocker unless I say otherwise.
- Update TODO.md when tasks are completed or new issues are found.
