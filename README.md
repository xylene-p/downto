# downto

Save events from Instagram to your calendar, see who else is going, form small squads.

## What it does

- Paste an IG link (or Letterboxd, or enter manually) to save an event
- Mark yourself as "down" — see which friends are too
- Post interest checks ("who's down for Thai tonight?") with configurable expiry and squad size
- Friends respond down/maybe/nah — start a squad chat from the responses
- Real-time messaging with logistics coordination (meeting spot, arrival time, transport)
- Push notifications so you don't miss when plans are forming

## Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Supabase** — auth (OTP), Postgres, RLS, Realtime, DB triggers
- **Web Push** — VAPID-based push notifications via service worker
- **Vercel** — deployment
- No CSS framework — inline styles, Space Mono + Instrument Serif fonts, dark theme with #E8FF5A accent

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local  # fill in Supabase + VAPID keys
npx supabase db push              # apply migrations
npm run dev
```
